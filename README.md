# A/B Testing to Check Customer Retention after Mobile banking Application Upgrade

In this project, I was able to analyse and compare 2 versions (Outdated version and Updated version) of mobile banking application to understand which is more effective.  

This was done amidst customers with different customerID  

Their retention rate was also tested after 30 days and 60 days.  

Having a deep understanding of this will aid the organization make an informed decision if their updated application version is what the users really need or if there is a need to get more feedback for better version to aid customers' retention on the long run.
